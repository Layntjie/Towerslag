# From Towerslag to Fairy Queen

## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}

I have worked as a scholar, commentator, sound archivist, musician and arts administrator. I have an intimate relationship with working class Cape Town, and have spent time working for an arts festival in the Klein Karoo – a beautiful and arid region of South Africa, and live in Muizenberg, Cape Town with my partner Tanya, and our daughter Ella. I write about cultural life, humanity and technology, development, history, and cultural policy. I listen to and play different kinds of music – mostly grounded in roots and jazz, and mostly on guitar.

In 2019 I completed a PhD. degree in History at the Centre for Humanities Research at the University of the Western Cape. I am currently working to develop my dissertation on ‘Goema’s Refrain’ into a book about goema – a folk vernacular of the Cape and the inspiration for its contribution to global jazz – in historical and aesthetic terms. A related film/ sound project is also in the works.

I have a range of related interests in cultural studies, history, museum and heritage studies, music performance, archival practice, sound studies and media and technology.

Towerslag is an Afrikaans word that speaks of magic, imagination, conjuring, mesmerizing, suprise and invention.
